| Subject | Why study? | Book | Videos |
| ------- | ---------- | ---- | ------ |
|Programming|Don’t be the person who “never quite understood” something like recursion.|Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs|Brian Harvey’s Berkeley CS 61A|
|Computer Architecture|If you don’t have a solid mental model of how a computer actually works, all of your higher-level abstractions will be brittle.|Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective|Berkeley CS 61C|
|Algorithms and Data Structures|If you don’t know how to use ubiquitous data structures like stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, you won’t be able to solve challenging problems.|The Algorithm Design Manual|Steven Skiena’s lectures|
|Math for CS|CS is basically a runaway branch of applied math, so learning math will give you a competitive advantage.|Mathematics for Computer Science|Tom Leighton’s MIT 6.042J|
|Operating Systems|Most of the code you write is run by an operating system, so you should know how those interact.|Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces|Berkeley CS 162|
|Computer Networking|The Internet turned out to be a big deal: understand how it works to unlock its full potential.|Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach|Stanford CS 144|
|Databases|Data is at the heart of most significant programs, but few understand how database systems actually work.|Readings in Database Systems|Joe Hellerstein’s Berkeley CS 186|
|Languages and Compilers|If you understand how languages and compilers actually work, you’ll write better code and learn new languages more easily.|Crafting Interpreters|Alex Aiken’s course on edX|
|Distributed Systems|These days, most systems are distributed systems.|Designing Data-Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann|MIT 6.824|
